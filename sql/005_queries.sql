CTE

Write an SQL query using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to determine the patients who meet the following conditions:
They rank between #5 and #20 based on the number of symptoms recorded in 2023.
Use the RANK() function for ranking patients in descending order of the total symptoms they had in 2023.
They have had a total of 4 or more appointments before January 1, 2023.
